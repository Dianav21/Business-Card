        <p>
        I am an aspiring frontend developer with a goal in trying to simplify and automate
        applications for all demographics. There is a bit of a disconnect with technology and the older generation. One of my goals is to spark that curiousity again and close that gap. I hope to be able to create applications that can be used to inform and incite positive change.
